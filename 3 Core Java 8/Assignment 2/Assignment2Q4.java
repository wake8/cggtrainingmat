/*
 * Test the following principles of an abstract class:
	
	• If any class has any of its method abstract then you must declare entire class abstract.
	
	• Abstract class cannot be instantiated.
	
	• When we extend an abstract class, we must either override all the abstract methods in sub class or declare subclass as abstract.
	
	• Abstract class cannot be private.
	
	• Abstract class cannot be final.
	
	• You can declare a class abstract without having any abstract method.
	
	Description:-
	* Write a program in such a way that all the conditions above for abstract class should satisfy.
